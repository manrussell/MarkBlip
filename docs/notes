folders for project
===================
src

docs
debug
release
schematics
original code for meeblip
- maybe put in winavr/usbasp drivers/zadig/ downloaded tutorials/datasheets

make file todo
==============

input  .c location
input  .h location
output location

update clean! or check it ...


Useful makefile variables
=========================

F_CPU = 16000000

# Target file name (without extension).
$(TARGET) ... TARGET = main

# List C source files here. (C dependencies are automatically generated.)
SRC = $(TARGET).c $(SRC_FOLDER)/uart.c

# List any extra directories to look for include files here.
EXTRAINCDIRS

useful make targets
==================

all printed at the top of the makefile.

to use programmers notepad to make and program, you must have the makefile
selected else it fails. -or use commandline

# Program the device.  --backup with burn fuses
program: $(TARGET).hex $(TARGET).eep
	$(AVRDUDE) $(AVRDUDE_FLAGS) $(AVRDUDE_WRITE_FLASH) $(AVRDUDE_WRITE_EEPROM) $(AVRDUDE_FUSES)
    
uart
====
use transistor as a ground use +'ve led pin as tx pin

usb cable - black wire is ground
?? check when its light - is tx pin

switch matrix
=============
when switches are up - near uC value is '0' (else we get 1,2,4,8)

need to have a delay -- used 12 nop's as any shorter still gave errors

when gpio set as input it floats, therefore to disable the column set as input

I have ignored the midi channel switches for now - just leave as input

POT array
=========
channel 0 is far right
